# OBJECTIVE
Describe as many issues and feature requests as I notice in the Android app v1.0.0 on my mobile phone within an hour.

# ISSUES
* When track mute is depressed, the cross on the muted speaker icon remains despite its colour is no longer red. Soundwise, the track is no longer muted, but the crossed speaker button is very confusing visually. 
* When the headphones are connected instead of the headset, I cannot record anything, i.e. the mic is expected to be present. *Android OpenSL* API only lists a single *Audio Input* entry. So I cannot choose the built-in mic as input and headphones as output. This blocks me from using the app without the headset.

# FEATURE REQUESTS
* ! Per-track *Solo* button please.
* ! *Cut* should not mute the selection, but delete it instead, i.e. the track contents should be moved respectively to the earlier point.
* ! Let the users move the recording to adjust against the latency or otherwise poor timing.
* ! Single Tap on a *Metronome* button should Enable/Disable the metronome. Longer Tap on the *Metronome* button should open the Metronome Settings. Or the other way around, but by no means do I have to do three taps to enable/disable metronome.
* Better metronome sound clicks please, e.g. think Ableton/Cubase.
* ! *Snap To Beat* should also be accessible with a single tap, i.e. not hidden in the Metronome Settings.
* Tap tempo area in the Metronome Settings please.
* The current zoom out level is not enough - I lose the sense of where am I in the project, I want to see where all tracks start and end.
* When a loop is enabled on a track, it'd be nice to get visual feedback, e.g. via waveform colour or something similar about the fact, that the waveform coming after the loop's end is that of the loop's start. Perhaps my mind is stuck with the DAW perception and expectations, but the current looping behaviour is very confusing for me. It feels like Momentum cannot decide whether it is a looper app or a non-linear audio recording app akin to a DAW.
* I find the horizontal screen layout with linear track lanes WAY MORE usable and clear than the vertical one with vinyl-like circular lanes.
* The *Test* button in the *Audio Options* does not allow to test the input, only the output - please make it possible to test recording too.
* *Listen To Input* switch in the *Settings* is not clear. I'd expect a level meter for the inputs here to see the visual feedback for Input Monitoring On/Off.
