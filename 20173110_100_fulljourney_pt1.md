# GOAL
Explore the Android app with a typical user journey for a musician - record an idea that has popped in my head when all I have is my mobile phone and likely no WiFi connection.


## NOTES
First I launch the app in vertical layout. What I see is a bunch of icons with names on a dark background, a playback bar, and some icons on top and bottom of the screens. At this point I feel always confused at what I'm looking. I don't have intuitive feeling that I'm seeing a list of my project which I can also preview. My first intention is to clicking on buttons at the bottom to go away and find the actual place to start. 
* ➡ I'd rather prefer to see the last project I used or blank one. I want to dive into the process while I have the idea in my head. Also, see MMT-1 in the issues list.

Graphically, the light button bars are too contrasty with the dark background. And the colourful 'emoji' for the projects make me feel like a dumb idiot rather than pro musician. I don't want to have a toy, I want to have a working tool.

* ➡ Improve the UI: the top and bottom button bars are too light, eat a lot of space, and are confusing with the meaning behind them, so probably an entirely new skin has to be created. Probably a good idea to have two default one, light and dark, but not one where you have light buttons and dark backgrounds. Probably a good idea is to stay consistent with SONAR for Cakewalk users, e.g. something similar to a Tungsten theme for a dark one.
* ➡ Improve the UI: make it less like a toy, give it some pro look.

Ok, I create a new idea by tapping the Lightbulb button. I do find the button itself confusing.

## ISSUES
* ❗ MMT-1: It turns out the last tab is remembered even if I kill the app. I don't think this is a good idea, so I'd prefer to always start with the First tab if the app was killed.
* ❗ MMT-2: After reopening the app a few times, it's got frozen. The last tab used it tried to reopen was Settings. Could not find a repro scenario so far.
