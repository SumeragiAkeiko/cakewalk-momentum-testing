**Duration:** 1h
**Platform:** Android 8.0 on Huawei Nexus 6P, Windows 10 x64, Sonar Platinum 2017.10 x64
**Version:** 1.0.1

# OBJECTIVE
Try out the new version.

# TESTING SUMMARY
Overall, Android app seems to be more stable and predictable now. VST needs its own stabilisation update. UX has to be reworked entirely everywhere. Cloud Sync already asks for a 2.0 file streaming feature as working with your phone and desktop in parallel will start causing huge pains otherwise.

# DETAILED NOTES
Installed 1.0.1 on Win 10 with Sonar Platinum and my Nexus 6P with Android 8.0.

## Launching Windows Standalone
* No audio device set by default.
* Only the first in/out pair are available via Windows Audio.
* Different sample rates for input and output are not supported via Windows Audio (shouldn't happen as WASAPI Shared resamples everything).
* All 1.0.0 ideas got synced successfully.

## Launching VST3 in Sonar Platinum 2017.10 x64
* Sound in Sonar gets muted due to ultra clipping (> +1000dB) coming from Momentum plugin
* Restart Sonar => now the tracks in Momentum are playable, but I get the sounds from Momentum VST playing twice as fast as they should be. Most likely due to the Samplerate in Sonar is 96kHz and audio in the Idea as recorded on Android was 48kHz. Or whatever other reason there is.
* About menu says 1.0.0 even though the Plugin Browser clearly states 1.0.1.333

## Launching Android on Nexus 6P with Android 8.0 
### Settings
* Still nothing is recorded when I connect Beyerdynamics DT880 Pro headphones, i.e. it seems OpenSL doesn't let you choose to playback on headphones and record on internal mic at the same time. Don't know whether these are limitations of Android OS in general or OpenSL specficially, but it's a shame. It seems that the working use case is either a headset or a USB soundcard (haven't tried the latter yet).
* Tried latency tests - results are quite unpredictable from one measurement. It seems I get slightly more consistent results if I set the volume to the max. Regardless, 384-sample buffer generates lower latencies than 192 samples, say 4400 vs 4200
### Ideas Browser
OK, choosing one of the existing ideas to edit.
### Idea
* Track mute button works - yay!
* No track solo buttons - ugh!
* Added stuff here and there, recorded a new track => no crashes or obvious misbehaviours so far
* Except that sync doesn't seem to work automatically until you go back to the Ideas menu. This caused a version conflict when I had changes in the Idea on Android and the same Idea opened on Win Standalone. I guess my expectations were of Google Docs behaviour - the changes are synced immediately as they are taken. I guess the relatively big audio data makes it difficult for such implementation (it's doable if you take NI Kontakt DFD or Google Drive File Stream as an idea - you're designing the future here after all).
